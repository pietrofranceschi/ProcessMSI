# ProcessMSI
Data analysis workflow for targeted MSI imaging experiments

## Details 
The preprocessing of targeted MSI data in our study is performed in following steps:

1. First, a reference mass bin was created of size 0.5.

2. Then, within desired mass bins, in our case, three ion peaks, namely: drug, tissue, and internal standard ion were selected. 


3. Peak selection was performed based on local maxima search in respective bins. In peak selection step, signal-to-noise value will estimate for each spectrum separately by sorting the intensity value in descending order and look in lower intensity region.

4. Drug, tissue and internal standard ion images were created. And, drug and tissue ion images were normalized with internal standard ion image.

5. Density-based thresholding was performed on tissue ion image to separate tumor tissue from the background area.

6. Final drug image was further smoothen using median filtering.
